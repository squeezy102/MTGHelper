## REQ-001: Card Panel - Contextual Card Display

When one or more cards are mentioned during a conversation, the right panel
displays detailed information for each identified card.

### Layout
The right panel is divided into three fixed sections stacked vertically:
1. **Image** (top) - card artwork
2. **Card Info** (middle) - all text printed on the physical card: name, mana cost,
   type line, oracle text, flavor text, power/toughness, artist, set
3. **Card Meta** (bottom) - external/contextual data: legality across formats,
   MTGA availability, pricing, and official rulings

A **tab bar** sits at the top of the right panel. Each tab represents one card
currently in the panel. Clicking a tab switches all three sections to show that
card's data. Each tab has an individual dismiss (x) button.

### Behavior
- When a new card is identified from the conversation, it is added to the tab bar
  and automatically selected (all three sections update to show it)
- All previously loaded cards remain accessible via their tabs
- Maximum of 10 cards held at once; when the cap is reached the oldest card is
  evicted (FIFO) to make room for the newest
- Cards persist across conversation turns until dismissed by the user
- Dismissing the active card auto-selects the next most recent card; if no cards
  remain, the panel returns to its empty placeholder state

## REQ-002: Chat Message Formatting

Assistant responses must be rendered as formatted, human-readable text rather
than a raw string dump.

- Assistant responses are rendered as markdown (bold, italics, headings, bullet
  points, numbered lists, code blocks)
- Card names appear in bold
- User messages are displayed as plain text (right-aligned)
- Error messages are visually distinct
- The LLM is instructed via system prompt to use markdown formatting in all responses
